# Coming soon!

This document will list out common troubleshooting steps (ex, check that the SBC plugged in and turned on) and common errors and how we resolved them.
It will differ from the FAQ in that the FAQ will be broad high level questions about Viam and its software while this will contain specific instructions for resolving difficulties with the software.
