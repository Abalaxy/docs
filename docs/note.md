## How to use Notes, Cautions, and Warnings

**Info/Tip**: Exactly that. They both use the same color.

**Note**: These call attention to something important. Use it to expand on a point from the body text or to provide a tip or additional information.

**Caution**: Provide notice that a certain action or event could damage hardware or cause data loss.

**Warning**: Use to notify the reader of an issue to avoid loss of life, personal injury, and health hazards. (Think Universal Arm on an unannounced rampage.)
